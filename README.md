my personal Discord bot to help automating tasks

 **- Prefix:**
 "$mishu" and it refers to the Pinyin spelling of the word "secretary" in Mandarin (mì shū).
 
 **- Command structure:**
 Prefix + space + command name + space + command args
 
 **- Available commands:**
 

 1. *ping* : (takes no arguments) classic ping-pong command, useful for debugging
 
 2. *str_eth_price* : (takes no arguments) Fetches current Ethereum price from Uniswap (expressed in [DAI](https://makerdao.com/en/))

 3. *embed* : (takes text in Markdown format as argument) some Markdown functionalities on Discord are limited to Bots, this command allows Human users to leverage the Bot's ability to create Embeds by passing Markdown text as an argument, the bot then will create an Embed out of it. A good use case is creating Hyperlinks: 
 Exp: $mishu embed [link text here](url here)
